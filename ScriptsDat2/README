This folder has the files to start uvIMS deployment, start tests, monitor performance, and start automatically tests.
This folder has the files to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with one master and six workers.
  -Before start the deployment, it is necessary to configurate ip addresses of kubernetes cluster VM in a file allocated in:
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    nano LocalFiles/AddressVM
  The AddressVM7 is the Kubernetes master and AddressVM0-AddressVM6 are workers
Start deployment:
  -Start Kubernetes master
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatMasterStart1.sh $SudoKubernetesMasterPassword
  -After Kubernetes master starts, the command line shows a token used to configurate Kubernetes Wokers or Kubernetes Slaves, you specify IP, port, and token, for example:
    kubeadm join 192.168.0.15:6443 --token 102952.1a7dd4cc8d1f4cc5 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:d68eda99caa1b5a05b5a763247d32e187f6935ad14dfc01cfbe881731c2dc392
  -Finally, uvIMS deployment starts with the following commands:
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatStart1.sh $NumberUsers $SudoPassword $DeploymentOption
  uvIMS starts metric-server if $DeploymentOption is equal to 10, if you do not want to start metric-server leave $DeploymentOption empty
Simple test:
  -Simple test with a CPS and fixed time:
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatMonitor1.sh $CPS $Duration $SudoPassword $OptionMonitor $NumberOfTests
  The $OptionMonitor indicates what it is going to be monitored:
    -1=dockers
    -2=VMs
    -3=dockers and VMs
Complete test:
  -Complete test from 25 cps to 200 cps with steps of 25 cps
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatFullCPSMonitor1.sh $Duration $SudoPassword $OptionMonitor $NumberOfTests

Full test:
  Full test for different combinations of uvIMS
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatFullMonitor1.sh $Duration $SudoPassword $OptionMonitor $NumberOfTests


After recollecting All data it is necessary to generate an information summary.
  -Simple information summary
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatGeneralDataSummary1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatDockerDataSummary1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatVMDataSummary1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
  -Complete summary information
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatFullCPSSummary1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests
  -Full summary information
    DatFullSummary1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests


After recollecting All data it is necessary to average information.
  -Simple average information
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatGeneralDataPromedy1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatDockerDataPromedy1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatVMDataPromedy1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
  -Complete average information
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatFullCPSPromedy1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests
  -Full average information
  cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2
    DatFullPromedy1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests


Finally, with the averaged information, the charts are next
  -The charts are generated with the following commands:
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat2/Graphs
    DatGraphFull1.sh
  The graphs are stored in the directory "~/ClearwaterTestResults/Graphs"
