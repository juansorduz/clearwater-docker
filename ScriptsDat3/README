This folder has the files to start tests, monitor performance, and start automatically tests.
Simple test:
  -Simple test with a CPS and fixed time:
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatMonitor1.sh $CPS $Duration $SudoPassword $OptionMonitor $NumberOfTests
  The $OptionMonitor indicates what it is going to be monitored:
    -2=VMs
    -3=dockers and VMs
Complete test:
  -Complete test from 25 cps to 200 cps with steps of 25 cps
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatFullCPSMonitor1.sh $Duration $SudoPassword $OptionMonitor $NumberOfTests

Full test:
  Full test for different combinations of uvIMS
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatFullMonitor1.sh $Duration $SudoPassword $OptionMonitor $NumberOfTests


After recollecting All data it is necessary to generate an information summary.
  -Simple information summary
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatGeneralDataSummary1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatDockerDataSummary1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatVMDataSummary1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
  -Complete summary information
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatFullCPSSummary1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests
  -Full summary information
    DatFullSummary1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests


After recollecting All data it is necessary to average information.
  -Simple average information
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatGeneralDataPromedy1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatDockerDataPromedy1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
    DatVMDataPromedy1.sh $CPS $duration $NumberOfTests
  -Complete average information
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatFullCPSPromedy1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests
  -Full average information
  cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3
    DatFullPromedy1.sh $Duration $NumberOfTests


Finally, with the averaged information, the charts are next
  -The charts are generated with the following commands:
    cd clearwater-docker/ScriptsDat3/Graphs
    DatGraphFull1.sh
  The graphs are stored in the directory "~/ClearwaterTestResults/Graphs"
